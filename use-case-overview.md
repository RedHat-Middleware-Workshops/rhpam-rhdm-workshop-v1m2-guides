# Use Case Overview

You are a business automation specialist consultant who was hired by a credit card issuer company, Pecunia Corp. Your task now is to automate the decisions and rules of a _Credit Card Dispute_ process.

## Credit Card Dispute - Transaction Risk

Every dispute has a possible risk to be incorrect or to be a fraud. Based on existing data, it is possible to determine the set that determines whether the dispute can be qualified for automated chargeback.

For Pecunia Corp., depending on the customer status and value disputed, the risks can be higher or lower. The bank handled the following rules to you:

- For a **standard** customer, and a dispute amount **between 0 and 100**, the risk is **low**.;
- For a **standard** customer, and a dispute amount **between 100 and 500**, the risk is **medium**;
- For a **standard** customer, and a dispute amount **above 500**, the risk is **high**.
- For a **silver** customer, and a dispute amount **below 250**, the risk is **low**.
- For a **silver** customer, and a dispute amount **between 250 and 500**, the risk is **medium**.
- For a **silver** customer, and a dispute amount **above 500**, the risk is **high**.
- For a **gold** customer, and a dispute amount **below 500**, the risk is **low**.
- For a **gold** customer, and a dispute amount **over 500**, the risk is **medium**.

In your implementation, the business users must have the ability to change criteria anytime if needed, and apply the changes according to the release processes of Pecunia Corp.

You should also consider that the user can change the criteria without technical assistance. Pecunia Corp., business users cannot code, therefore, your solution should allow them to update the rules using standard spreadsheet-like decision tables or quasi natural language.

Make sure you also deliver automated tests for your rules.
